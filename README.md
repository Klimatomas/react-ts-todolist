# react-ts-todolist

A simple project to learn how to start project from scratch, using react with typescript.

Primary goal was to start a project without depending on create-react-app and learn the stuff around deployments (Heroku) and Webpack (v.4)

The app is connected to NodeJS backend (Express) and in near future it should allow user to authenticate and save/load their ToDo's in database (MongoDB served via) -- not implemented yet

Current version can be found deployed and running on http://react-ts-todolist.herokuapp.com/
